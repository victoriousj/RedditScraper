## Usage

Use Git to clone the repository. Open the solution inVisual Studio if you want to develop it.

You can also run the included .exe which contains all the assemblies needed run this, though
who would trust an .exe from a random person's Github page?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/victoriousj/asp.net-reddit-scraper.git
```

## About

This started as a friend wanted me to grab every image they posted to /r/Breadit (a subreddit for bakers)
so I started to look into the Reddit OAuth API and that led me here. I quickly put this together so there
are probably some problems with how this works but I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. Feel free to
edit this and make it your own.
